The 9th Games and Natural Language Processing (Games and NLP 2022)—to be held at
LREC 2022 — will examine the use of games and gamification for Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, as well as how NLP research can advance player
engagement and communication within games. The Games and NLP workshop aims to
promote and explore the possibilities for research and practical applications of
games and gamification that have a core NLP aspect, either to generate resources
and perform language tasks or as a game mechanic itself. This workshop
investigates computational and theoretical aspects of natural language research
that would be beneficial for designing and building novel game experiences, or
for processing texts to conduct formal game studies. NLP would benefit from
games in obtaining language resources (e.g., construction of a thesaurus or a
parser through a crowdsourcing game), or in learning the linguistic
characteristics of game users as compared to those of other domains.


**Paper topics may include, but are not limited to:**

-  Games for collecting data useful for NLP (games in planning, underdevelopment, or deployed)
-  Gamification of NLP tasks (techniques, best practice and evaluation of gamification strategies)
-  Player motivation and experience (strategies for recruitment/retention and player profiling)
-  Game design (conceptual design elements and reports of success and/or failure of designs)
-  Novel uses of natural language processing or generation as a game mechanic
-  Natural language in games as an alternative method of input for people with disabilities
-  Processing NLP game data (aggregation methods and strategies for minimising noise and cheating)
-  Analysis of large-scale game-related corpora (e.g., game reviews, game play logs)
-  Real-time sentiment analysis of player discourse or chat
-  Evaluation of games for NLP (metrics for evaluating game performance,
evaluating player performance, motivation and bias, and evaluating task
difficulty)
-  Serious games for learning languages
-  Player immersion in language-enabled mixed reality or physically embodied games
-  Narrative plot or text generation of text-based interactive narrative systems
-  Natural language understanding and generation of character dialogue
-  Ethical and privacy concerns of ownership of text and audio chat in massively multiplayer online games.

We encourage participants to share frequently used metrics for assessing game
and player performance, further instructions for how to produce these can be
found on our website. 

## Important Dates

{% include dates.md %}

## Submissions

We invite submissions of full papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages), and
extended abstracts (2 pages). Page lengths are excluding references and metrics.

Full and short papers will present original research and appear in the workshop
proceedings. Full and short papers will be presented as talks or at the poster
and demo session, and the proceedings published on the LREC 2022 and Games and
NLP 2022 websites.

Extended abstracts will showcase demonstrations, works in progress, and
position papers. These papers will be non-archival and will provide authors with
the opportunity to showcase ongoing work and focused, relevant contributions.
All authors will be sent feedback and final decision of acceptance.
 
## Review Process

Full and short papers will be reviewed double blind by at least two of the
programme committee before a meta-review by the organisers (so, please take care
to anonymise your submissions). We encourage authors to take whatever space they
need; papers will be judged on the merit of their ideas, not length.
 Extended abstracts will be reviewed by the organising committee. These
submissions will be reviewed single blind by two of the programme committee
before a meta-review by the organisers.


We acknowledge the difficulty of attending these events in person. For those
with personal, financial, or political inability for travel we are happy to
organize remote presentations.

Games and NLP is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. Our
anti-harassment policy can be found in our Code of Conduct.

## Identify, Describe and Share your LRs!

Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission
procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To
continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools,
web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility,  when submitting a
paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  This effort of sharing LRs,
linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature
for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository
where everyone can deposit and share data.

As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow
the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments
conducted by other researchers, LREC 2022 endorses the need to uniquely Identify
LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number
(ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each
Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers  will be
offered at submission time.
