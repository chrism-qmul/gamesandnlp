# Welcome to the Games and Natural Language Processing Workshop at LREC 2022

The Games and NLP Workshop at [LREC 2022](https://lrec2022.lrec-conf.org/en/) will examine the use of games and gamification
for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, as well as how NLP research can
advance player engagement and communication within games. The workshop will have
presentations of accepted papers (full, short, extended abstracts), an invited
talk, and a poster and demo session. 

Important Dates: TBD

One of the most difficult challenges in citizen science games is player
recruitment.  For the first invited talk, Jérôme Waldispühl will share his
experience  embedding the citizen science game Phylo into Borderlands 3, a AAA
massively multiplayer online game.  This partnership with the American Gut
Project encourages Borderlands players to conduct RNA molecular sequence
alignment through regular play of the Borderlands 3 game, resulting in a
large-scale collection.

Recent industrial interests in intelligent conversational agents spurred on by
systems such as Alexa and Apple Siri have driven a demand for approaches and
re-sources pertaining to task-oriented dialogue.  In this keynote, Hikaru Yokono
will share his work on using the popular game Minecraft as a sandbox for
collecting task-orientated dialogue data from players.
