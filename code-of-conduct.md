The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central
to the aims and goals of the Games and NLP 2021 Workshop. **The organisers of
Games and NLP 2021 commit to providing a harassment-free, accessible, inclusive,
and pleasant conference experience with equity in rights for all.** We want every
participant to feel welcome, included, and safe at the conference.

We aim to provide a safe, respectful, and harassment-free conference environment
for everyone involved regardless of age, sex, gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, race,
ethnicity, nationality, marital status, military status, veteran status,
religious beliefs, dietary requirements, medical conditions, pregnancy-related
concerns or childcare requirements. We also respect any other status protected
by laws of the country in which the workshop is being held.

**We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants**. We expect all
interactions between Games and NLP members to be respectful and constructive,
including interactions during the review process, at the conference itself, and
on social media. Conference participants who violate the terms of this policy
may not be welcome to submit to or attend future Games and NLP meetings.

Concerns should be brought to the attention of the conference organisers in
person (if needed) and definitely in writing, and will be investigated and
reviewed by our Committee. If there is an immediate need for intervention,
outside law enforcement authorities may need to be contacted.
